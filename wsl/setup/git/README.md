GitHub Credential Sharing: Windows (PowerShell) to WSL (Arch Linux)
This guide explains how to share the GitHub credentials generated by VS Code on Windows with your Arch Linux distribution in WSL.

1. Verify Credentials on Windows
VS Code stores credentials in the Windows Credential Manager via the Git Credential Manager (GCM). To verify the current helper location in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
# Check where the helper is defined
git config --list --show-origin | Select-String "credential.helper"
```


2. Configure X Linux (WSL)
You must tell the Linux Git to use the Windows executable as its credential store. Run these commands inside your X terminal:

Link the Windows Credential Manager

```Bash
# Link X to the Windows GCM executable

git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager.exe"
```

Optimize for WSL

```Bash
# Ensure smooth communication between Linux and the Windows .exe
git config --global credential.useHttpPath true
```

3. Set Up Identity (Required)
The credential helper handles authentication (logging in), but you still need to define your identity (signing commits) inside Arch:

```Bash
# Set your GitHub identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

4. Final Verification
To ensure everything is working correctly, check your global configuration in Arch:

```Bash
git config --global --list
```

Expected output:
- credential.helper points to the .exe path in /mnt/c/.
- user.name and user.email are correctly set.
Now, when you perform a git push or git pull in Arch, it will automatically use the session you started in VS Code.
